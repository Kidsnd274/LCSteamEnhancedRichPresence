# LCSteamEnhancedRichPresence
Doesn't work because the game developer has to setup localization for Rich Presence in Steamworks.

"steam_display" - Names a rich presence localization token that will be displayed in the viewing user's selected language in the Steam client UI. See Rich Presence Localization for more info, including a link to a page for testing this rich presence data. If steam_display is not set to a valid localization tag, then rich presence will not be displayed in the Steam client.
